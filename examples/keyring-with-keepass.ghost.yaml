# This configuration file will grant ghost access to your Keepass database,
# automatically unlocking it on request. The master password is stored in the
# system keyring. This assumes that you:
# 1. Trust the system keyring to secure store your master password.
# 2. Run this ghost command sometime before you access the keepass database:
#
#    ghost set --keeper=systemKeyring \
#        --id personal-keepass.kdbx-master-password \
#        --prompt
#
# And then enter your password.
#
# This assumes that you trust the System Keyring to be secure.
