# This configuration sets up a LastPass vault that is unlocked with a temporary
# password stored by presenting a pinentry form for you to enter. This password
# is then held in memory for an hour after you set it and then needs to be
# re-entered.
#
# Before this configuration will do any good, you will need to start the ghost
# service with the following command:
#
#   ghost service start --keeper=tempPolicy --enforce-all-policies &
#
# Then, you can work with your LastPass passwords using:
#
#   ghost get --name=github.com --show-password
#   ghost set --name=google.com --username some.email@example --prompt
#
# You'll only be asked for your LastPass password at most once per hour.
