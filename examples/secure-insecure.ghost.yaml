# Sometimes you may want to treat some secrets less carefully and don't mind
# storing them in a plaintext file. For example, you may want to store a GitHub
# API token on your laptop in a plaintext file.
#
# Using ghost, you can have some secrets stored securely and others not. Here
# you will be prompted for your master password every time you get a secure
# password, but not for the insecure ones.
